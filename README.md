### Game Description

Play as a scientist who has lost control of the lab. Test subjects are on the loose, and they are out for revenge. How long can you survive?

## Your Additions

(Checkpoint 2) I plan to make all of the assets myself. I am going to try to stick to the minimum viable product in order to have plenty of time for asset production.

(Checkpoint 4) I did all of the assets from scratch, however, I also added a lot of complexity with a custom animation system, wave system, A* pathfinding, and an event based collision system used for various purposes throughout the project.

## Sources

-   All sprites, animations, scripts, sound design, and every other piece of media in the project was made by me
-   Guide to A* pathfinding algorithm by Sebastian Lague, more details in revelant script

## Known Issues

There are no known errors. 

### Requirements not completed

Not neccessarily a requirement, but there is a very distinct lack of sound design besides the wave completion motif. Looking back, I wish I would have set aside more time for production (more sound effects, animations) instead of prototyping mechanics.
